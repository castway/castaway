				<h3 class="about-header">Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
				<span class="paragraph">CASTAWAY is located at:</span><br />
				<address class="paragraph">
					CASTAWAY<br />Grabiszyńska 214, Wrocław <br />53-235 -
					Dolnośląskie , Polska<br />castawayapp123@gmail.com
				</address>

				<p class="paragraph">
					It is CASTAWAY's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
					information we may collect while operating our website. This
					Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://castawayapp.tech">https://castawayapp.tech</a>
					(hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://castawayapp.tech"). We
					respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
					identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We
					have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what
					information may be collected on our Website, how we use this
					information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the
					information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
					information we collect through the Website and does not apply to
					our collection of information from other sources.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions
					posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies
					governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities
					when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to
					additional terms and conditions.</p>

				<h2 class="about-header">Website Visitors</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Like most website operators, CASTAWAY collects
					non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
					browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
					type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
					each visitor request. CASTAWAY's purpose in collecting
					non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
					CASTAWAY's visitors use its website. From time to time, CASTAWAY
					may release non-personally-identifying information in the
					aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
					its website.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">CASTAWAY also collects potentially personally-identifying
					information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
					users and for users leaving comments on https://castawayapp.tech
					blog posts. CASTAWAY only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
					addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
					personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

				<h2 class="about-header">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Certain visitors to CASTAWAY's websites choose to interact
					with CASTAWAY in ways that require CASTAWAY to gather
					personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
					information that CASTAWAY gathers depends on the nature of the
					interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
					https://castawayapp.tech to provide a username and email address.</p>

				<h2 class="about-header">Security</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">The security of your Personal Information is important to us,
					but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or
					method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
					commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information,
					we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

				<h2 class="about-header">Advertisements</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by
					advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
					ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
					online advertisement to compile information about you or others who
					use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
					other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe
					will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use
					of cookies by CASTAWAY and does not cover the use of cookies by any
					advertisers.</p>


				<h2 class="about-header">Links To External Sites</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not
					operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be
					directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
					review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site
					you visit.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the
					content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites,
					products or services.</p>


				<h2 class="about-header">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">CASTAWAY discloses potentially personally-identifying and
					personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
					contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
					information in order to process it on CASTAWAY's behalf or to
					provide services available at CASTAWAY's website, and (ii) that
					have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
					contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of
					your home country; by using CASTAWAY's website, you consent to the
					transfer of such information to them. CASTAWAY will not rent or
					sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
					information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and
					affiliated organizations, as described above, CASTAWAY discloses
					potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
					information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
					governmental request, or when CASTAWAY believes in good faith that
					disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
					rights of CASTAWAY, third parties or the public at large.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">If you are a registered user of https://castawayapp.tech and
					have supplied your email address, CASTAWAY may occasionally send
					you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
					or just keep you up to date with what's going on with CASTAWAY and
					our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
					information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
					If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
					one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it
					in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help
					us support other users. CASTAWAY takes all measures reasonably
					necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
					alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
					personally-identifying information.</p>

				<h2 class="about-header">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">CASTAWAY may collect statistics about the behavior of
					visitors to its website. CASTAWAY may display this information
					publicly or provide it to others. However, CASTAWAY does not
					disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>


				<h2 class="about-header">Cookies</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">To enrich and perfect your online experience, CASTAWAY uses
					"Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to
					display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store
					your preferences on your computer.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on
					a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to
					the website each time the visitor returns. CASTAWAY uses cookies to
					help CASTAWAY identify and track visitors, their usage of
					https://castawayapp.tech, and their website access preferences.
					CASTAWAY visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
					computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
					CASTAWAY's websites, with the drawback that certain features of
					CASTAWAY's websites may not function properly without the aid of
					cookies.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">By continuing to navigate our website without changing your
					cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to CASTAWAY's use
					of cookies.</p>



				<h2 class="about-header">Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">Although most changes are likely to be minor, CASTAWAY may
					change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in CASTAWAY's sole
					discretion. CASTAWAY encourages visitors to frequently check this
					page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of
					this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute
					your acceptance of such change.</p>



				<h2 class="about-header">CASTAWAY's way of operation</h2>
				<p class="paragraph">CASTAWAY was created solely as a portfolio project and
					therefore will never commercially use your data. The information we
					get from your social media (if you decide to authenticate yourself
					using your social media accounts) is your name and email.</p>
